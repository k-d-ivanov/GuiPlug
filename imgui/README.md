Clone files from ["Dear Imgui"](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) repository.
And copy/replace them here.(probably follow the folder structure, otherwise you'll need to change include_dirs)

- Backends used from this repo: **imgui_impl_glfw**;
- Renderers used from this repo: **imgui_impl_opengl3**;

If you want to use different backends and renderers,
check ["Dear Imgui" docs/wiki](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki), for detailed explanation on how to do that.
Currently I'm **not** planing to support other than those mentioned above.
